Megastage Paradox:

Requirements:
 - Travel time from planet to moon (<20 min)    1 Mkm ->     100 000m
 - Travel time between planets (<30 min)      100 Mkm -> 
 - Travel time between star systems (<30 min)

FTL mechanism will handle the last problem
 - mounted ftl (jump drive) can jump to 100 diameter, jump takes 5-15 min, can misjump.
 - jump gate, receives jump capable ships without misjumps or diameter limits.
