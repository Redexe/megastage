DCPU-16 Hardware Info:
    Name: Model S8 Manouver Drive (engine)
    ID: 0xa8fb6730
    Version: 0xad3c
    Manufacturer: 0xe1e0bd31 (GENERAL DRIVES)

Description:
    Ships move through ordinary space using maneuver drives. Power for the S8MD
    is provided by the ship's power plant.

    S8MD feds hydrogen fuel into the ignition chamber and uses lasers to trigger
    a thermonuclear explosion to push the ship forward.

    Engine's power intake in safe operation area is from 0 to 992MW. Engine
    thrust is logarithmically proportional to the input power. Manufacturer's
    test data is available in separate data sheet.

    Engine is equipped with safety mechinism to prevent uncontrolled chain
    reaction in ignition chamber.

Interrupt behavior:
    When a HWI is received by the S8MD, it reads the A register and does one
    of the following actions:
    
    0: SET_POWER_LEVEL
       Reads the B register and sets the engine's power intake to B / 66.0 MW.
       If B is 0 or insufficient power is available, the safety circuit will
       immediately shutdown the engine. Powering the engine from shutdown
       state takes 20 to 60 seconds.

    1: REQUEST_IDENTIFICATION
       Engine's identification number is set to B register. Unique ID-number for
       each engine is defined by shipyard and each engine's location and thrust
       direction can be validated from ship owner's manual.
