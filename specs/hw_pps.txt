DCPU-16 Hardware Info:
    Name: Pulsar Positioning System (navigator)
    ID: 0xcb4c0cb7
    Version: 0x6509
    Manufacturer: 0x91a2b24c (TALON NAVIGATION SYSTEMS)

Description:
    PPS can determine it's position using signals from x-ray pulsars.

Interrupt behavior:
    When a HWI is received by the PPS, it reads the A register and does one
    of the following actions:
    
    0: SECTOR
       Write current sector number to register B. Numbers from 0x0000 to
       0x00ff are reserved for special codes.
          0x0000       : Unknown sector
          0x0001       : No known pulsars detected
          0x0002       : Equipment malfunction

    1: COORDINATES
       Reads the B register, and writes the current position data to DCPU-16
       ram starting at address B. Halts the DCPU-16 for 7 cycles.

       The data is encoded as
         SINT32: x-coordinate (m)
         SINT32: y-coordinate (m)
         SINT32: z-coordinate (m)
         UINT16: time synchronization pulse (ms)

       Synchronization pulse is 16 bit counter that increments every
       millisecond and resets to zero between every 2^16 seconds.
       All PPS-units simultaneously conclude the same synchronization 
       pulse value regardles of their position or speed.
