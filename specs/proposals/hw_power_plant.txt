Fusion Power Plant
    





DCPU-16 Hardware Info:

    Name: Power Plant
    ID: 0x3A57E911, version: 0x0911
    Manufacturer: 0xa3783fc8 (Cradle Tech)




Description:

    
Interrupt behavior:
    When a HWI is received by the Enter name here, it reads the A register and
    does one of the following actions:
    
    0: GET_STATUS

    1: SET_PRODUCTION

    2: GET_TEMPERATURE


NOTE: possible tinkering variables (mean):
minimum field size (5m)
energy / m2 (50kWs)
energy conversion rate (1.0) 
cleanup period (30s)
evaporation rate (0.5% / s)
laser absorbtion rate (1.0)
plasma absorbtion rate (1.0)




    Sets the B register to the estimated radius of the Enter name here, in centimetres minus 400. If the device is off or an error has triggered, 
it will be set to 0 and C will be set to one of these error codes:
0x0000 No errors - the device was shut down or never started
0x0001 Not enough energy - there isn't enough energy connected
0x0002 Forcefield destroyed - The forcefield was damaged. When a forcefield
 is destroyed, the energy it would usually need for 150 ticks at the last radius to
boot it up is required.
0xFFFF Unknown error - Explosions are funny.


    1: SET_RADIUS
       Reads the B register and sets the Forcefield-Radius to that. If the current
energy supply is too low, it will consume the energy but not make a
forcefield.
Setting B to 0 will shut the device down.


    2: GET_ENERGY_CONSUMPTION
       Reads the B register, and puts a 64-bit number starting at the RAM
at address B in kW. This is the estimated energy consumtion calculated by the
formula sqrt(((1.7r)^2*pi+r^(12/5))/k)^3, while r is the actual radius/1cm.
k is Enter energy constant here (I don't know how hard it will be to produce
energy). Halts the DCPU for 8 cycles. The formula is an estimation, the
device' actual energy consumption might differ by hundreds of kW.


    3: GET_RADIUS
       Gets the estimated radius that can be done with the current energy
consumption. This is estimated by reverting the formula above (calling
a math genius to calculate it xD). This isn't exact and can differ by a few metres
to the actual consumption.


    4: SET_ENERGY_CONSUMPTION
    Reads the 64-bit unsigned Integer starting at memory address B. By
default (or if the integer is 0), the Enter name here consumes all the energy
It can get, if there is more energy than needed the energy is simply wasted.
If this is set to anything except 0, it will only use this amount of energy.
